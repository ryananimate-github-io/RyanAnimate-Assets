# GoAnimate Assets
These are the Asset server files for the old GoAnimate. Basicly a bunch of files are stored from a server so other sites connect to it.

### about
Cool domain with all of the archived old goanimate assets attempting to bring back the legacy video maker in 2021 saving the world of LVM clones! and it has some LVM clones including the old goanimate website built into it. this domain can be used anytime. this domain is updated somtimes because somtimes there is nothing to archive or do. but about the character creators, videomakers, and the video players. well i will work on that soon.
