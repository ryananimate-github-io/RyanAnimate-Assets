<p>Wellcome to the ccpack folder! You can import assets here. but in order to import, you have to fork this project, add your files, put them in this code:</p>
<p><prop id="cryin.swf" name="Crying" holdable="0" placeable="1" wearable="0" facing="left" thumb="" enable="Y" is_premium="N" aid="6652" money="0" sharing="0"/></p>
<p>You can edit the file name and change hte name to the way you want it to be. for example:</p>
<p><prop id="dining_room.png" name="Real Life Dinning Room" holdable="0" placeable="1" wearable="0" facing="left" thumb="" enable="Y" is_premium="N" aid="6650" money="0" sharing="0"/></p>
<p>After that, you have to create a pull request. if i trust your pull request, i will apply it.</p>
<p>if i dont trust your pull request, then your hard work on importing is denied! so dont get the i dont trust phase from me!</p>
<p>Thanks for importing!</p>
