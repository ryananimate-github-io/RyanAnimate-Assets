<h2 id="legalese-stuff">Legalese Stuff</h2>

<h3 id="keep-it-libre">1. Keep it libre</h3>
<p>Libre: the spanish word for free as in freedom. (free as in no price is "gratis") The idea that users should always have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve software. (You can read more about it <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">here.</a>) I follow this philosophy heavily. While I don't go as far as excluding ever using proprietary software (i still use steam and play games on it, i still use discord, i still use windows if necesssary), I try to keep everything I use libre if possible and a suitable replacement. And for Wrapper: Offline, something I was *making* myself, I stuck to my guns hard to keep it as free as possible. Outside of the original GoAnimate assets (which are obviously proprietary, or we wouldn't be having a problem), I made sure that all code I wrote myself was freely accessible in the same download. That was mostly batch scripts, and the project already had a libre software license, so that kinda happened by default, but still. I also ensured that if I needed to add an external tool for some sort of function, it was also libre software. You might have noticed the "sourcecode" folder in utilities, this contains the source code for every tool I included with W:O. Not useful to most people who can't understand it, but it ensures anyone who gets a full copy of Wrapper: Offline has everything they need to tweak whatever they want exactly how they want. This was very important to me. It's the reason I was able to start the project. It's the reason it's able to be taken on and developed further after me. And if you follow along, it'll be the reason the people after you can keep working on it too. I won't ask you to go to an extreme of refusing proprietary software if there's no replacement, but I ask that you look far and wide before giving up on it. The easiest way to find what you need is to search for something like "open source music player" or "open source image editor", or to look around on GitHub. Check the license, check if it's approved by the Free Software Foundation, and if it is then be sure to include the program's source code with W:O installs. Also, if you're wondering, "open source" has a lot of overlap and usually is the same as libre software, but saying open source tends to be more about marketing and just seeing the source code, not about freedom and privacy which are my goals with it.</p>

<h3 id="dont-step-on-vyonds-toes">2. Don't step on Vyond's toes</h3>
<p>There's a very, very, VERY good reason I strictly kept the Business themes out and tried to strip usage of the Vyond/GoAnimate names. Those are still in use. I wanted to preserve the content Vyond wouldn't, but I didn't want to replace them. I didn't want to become a threat to them. So I made it absolutely clear that I would not distribute business themes, and I would not give any way to download them. Only distribute what they're not using. I assure you they have no plans of bringing back their theme that's basically linked with videos where Caillou gets yelled at by his parents. But they definitely want to use Business Friendly, considering businesses are their target audience right now. And yes, legitimate business people do buy Vyond. Not sure what happened to the screenshot, but sometime a few months ago I saw an ad on YouTube made with business friendly. Think it was some kind of ad about back pain or women's care or something? I dunno. Point stands.</p>

<h2 id="development">Wrapper Development</h2>

<h3 id="keep-it-accessible-for-everyone-past-present-and-future">3. Keep it accessible for everyone; past, present, and future</h3>
<p>Don't assume the user has ever even used GoAnimate before. Don't assume they understand technical details. Don't assume they're in the past, present, or the future. You want to keep everything understandable for both a long-time Comedy World user, and for someone in 2685 rediscovering what we've preserved and doesn't know a damn thing about it. And yes, I developed with the idea that someone might find a USB stick in some old rubble centuries from now and find a untouched copy of Wrapper: Offline. Literally that exact scenario. But either way: keep the name "offline" true (although if a feature REQUIRES the internet, such as the text to speech voices for the most part, you can do that, but try to make it work offline if possible), and assume that the user has absolutely zero way to get anything they might need that isn't included with W:O itself. You're linking something? The URL standard changed back in 2174, no websites with the old standard function. You need a component to be manually downloaded? The company that makes it shut down 400 years ago, literally nobody who worked there is alive anymore and anything they made has been lost to time. It might sound a little silly, and that's because I like to be entertaining, but it's an important exaggeration to the end goal of preservation.</p>

<h3 id="keep-the-code-clean-and-understandable">4. Keep the code clean and understandable</h3>
<p>This one is pretty simple, but worth including. Pretty much just, use good coding practices. I made lots of comments describing the code I wrote for W:O, and that helps a lot both for you developing it and for anyone in the future understanding the code. Try to use the cleanest code possible, rather than a big garbled mess of letters. Stuff like that.</p>

<h2 id="community-management">Community Management</h2>

<h3 id="keep-the-community-server-accessible-and-focused">5. Keep the community server accessible and focused</h3>
<p>This one is more of a thing about community management than development, and in a way I expect this to be the hardest one to follow, but try to keep the server for W:O only about W:O with no general discussion or anything outside of that, and keep any biases against anyone out of the picture. Don't ban people unless they cause issues directly in the server, not because people don't like them outside of it. Even if someone's an asshole, they should have the right to get access to W:O and get proper support if they need it. In Wrapper Chat or whatever? Go ahead, ban all the jerks you want. And if someone stirs up trouble in the main server, get them out. But if they're just asking about how to fix something, and especially if they're not even saying anything, just let them be. Respecting even your enemies goes a long way.</p>

<h3 id="be-nice">6. Be nice</h3>
<p>Don't get aggressive, even if someone's being an annoyance. Have patience and try to ask them to clarify what they need better or to stop doing what's annoying you. Also, don't feed in to jerks by getting angry. Of course, don't be all soft and let them walk over you too. Be firm, give them a stern warning to stop (as in, literally just say "@themeanguy, stop calling them stupid."), and if they don't listen: ban them without a word. Don't give them attention by calling them out strongly or calling them anything back, that's exactly what they want. This one's honestly more of a general life lesson, but I had to keep it in mind a lot while managing the community for W:O. Admittedly, this one's a little hypocritical because a few times I called out people when they were begging for things, without directly being rude to me. For example, one person messaged me every single hour for a whole like two fucking days asking if I had finished making a video tutorial for installing W:O. When I finally posted it, I added something like "special thanks to @tutorialdmseveryhour for messaging me every hour until i posted this". I still find that funny. The guy never even noticed, he was just like THANKS BENSON!! and never noticed I was very clearly annoyed. I find that even funnier. But that was right when I started the project. Nowadays, I wouldn't want to make people go after the person, nor would I want to possibly give in if they were intentionally being an annoyance.</p>

<h2 id="end">End</h2>

<h3 id="dont-be-afraid-to-have-fun-with-things">7. Don't be afraid to have fun with things</h3>
<p>I included tons of little jokes in W:O, and I made my announcement posts humorous while conveying the information needed. A few of my favorite W:O easter eggs include: "patching" W:O with a image in utilities, the comments for the beginning messages of the batch script being the voice clips when starting the game Boneworks, my favorite song in the Half-Life 2 soundtrack "you're not supposed to be here" playing when you click those words on the 404 page, and the "Browser Slayer" taskkilling all the browsers when installing Flash. Hell, the "random" command is literally just a bunch of stupid in-jokes with my friends. Will people in the future understand it? Most likely not. But it doesn't hurt functionality at all, and it adds charm to the program that makes it feel less like a stone cold thing you use to make videos and more like something made by people who care. Of course, don't make everything into a big joke; but if you're making a 404 page or have room for the user to freely type something, no harm in making a potato fly across the screen if the user types potato.</p>
