<h2 id="about-wrapper-offline">About josephcrosmanplays532.github.io</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-wrapper-offline">What is josephcrosmanplays532.github.io?</h3>
<p>josephcrosmanplays532.github.io is a domain where all of the old goanimate stuff is stored witch allows the legacy video maker to come back in 2021. it even has the old goanimate website built into it so you can create videos in the josephcrosmanplays532.github.io domain!</p>
<h3 id="what-is-wrapper-offline">Hey! Why is there some business themes on josephcrosmanplays532.github.io?</h3>
<p>The Old GoAnimate Videomaker used came with the business themes and desided to use them.</p>


<h3 id="will-it-work-forever-even-after-flash-is-retired">Will it work forever? Even after Flash is retired?</h3>
<p>I will be making a source code for that.</p>


  

<h3 id="wait-chromium-ive-heard-something-about-that-being-a-virus">Wait… Chromium? I’ve heard something about that being a virus…</h3>
<p>Chromium is literally Chrome. It’s the libre software base Google uses to build Chrome, and then they tack proprietary parts like auto-updates and Google integration in so it’s more appealing and they have more control over your experience. Ungoogled-chromium is just a version of Chromium that has any Google integration that’s left in Chromium removed for privacy.
If you don’t trust me, feel free to look through the code on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium">https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium</a>
And these VirusTotal results for it: <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bab1f622f9a966baffa07838c305e586715979db884cd7369df96bb08c092f8a/detection">https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bab1f622f9a966baffa07838c305e586715979db884cd7369df96bb08c092f8a/detection</a>
And you can also see an independent report from this site that analyzes software for spyware traits: <a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/ungoogled_chromium.html">https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/ungoogled_chromium.html</a></p>

<h2 id="using-offline">Using Online</h2>

<h3 id="how-do-i-use-it">How do I use it?</h3>
<p>boi just go on the site</p>


<h3 id="can-i-import-character-ids-from-the-original-lvm">Can I import character IDs from the original LVM?</h3>
<p>Also yes! To do that, go to the matching character creator, and paste <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;original_asset_id=ID HERE</code> at the end of the URL.</p>






<h3 id="file-uploading-isnt-working">File uploading isn’t working!</h3>
<p>too bad dont have any way to fix this</p>
<h3 id="business-friendly-and-whiteboard-are-missing">Business Friendly and Whiteboard are missing!</h3>
<p>I go into this in more detail in the legalese section, but basically Vyond is still using them so I won’t include them in Offline.</p>

<h3 id="watermarks-arent-working">Watermarks aren’t working!</h3>
<p>This is likely tied to file uploading not working. You’re likely better off either placing them over your video as a prop, or using a video editor to place them on your video. My recommendations are Kdenlive and OpenShot, both of them are libre software you can use for free.</p>



<h3 id="starters-arent-working">Starters aren’t working!</h3>
<p>I will be fixing this somtime soon. if i can't fix it, then i will have to change the apiserver and copy the save.js file from GoAnimate Wrapper.</p>



<h3 id="why-is-business-friendly-missing">Why does this domain not look like wrapper offline?</h3>
<p>Because i desided not to use wrapper offline for this doamin. this domain is ment to revive goanimate and not to program wrapper offline.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-you-avoid-mentioning-the-original-service-goanimatevyond">Why do you avoid mentioning the original service GoAnimate/Vyond?</h3>
<p>Because they are NOT affiliated or endorsing this project in any form. Wrapper: Offline is and almost certainly always will be a completely separate project. That’s why the full name is simply Wrapper: Offline, and referring to it with that company’s name (such as calling it GoAnimate Wrapper Offline) is wrong.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-you-avoid-mentioning-the-original-service-goanimatevyond">Is https://goanimateforschools.github.io free?</h3>
<p>Yes it is! just type in <a href="https://goanimateforschools.github.io/dashboard/videos">https://goanimateforschools.github.io/dashboard/videos</a> and it should not requrie any attention. i put the login and signup codes there for a reason.</p>
	
<h3 id="why-do-you-avoid-mentioning-the-original-service-goanimatevyond">Why does this site go down somtimes?</h3>
<p>Because of an error and somtimes, deployment problems. if you want to learn more about the deploy times, <a href="deploymenttimes">click here</a>.</p>
